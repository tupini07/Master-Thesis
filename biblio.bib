 title = {Practical introduction to record linkage for injury research.},
 abstract = {The frequency of early fatality and the transient nature of emergency medical
      care mean that a single database will rarely suffice for population based injury 
      research. Linking records from multiple data sources is therefore a promising
      method for injury surveillance or trauma system evaluation. The purpose of this
      article is to review the historical development of record linkage, provide a
      basic mathematical foundation, discuss some practical issues, and consider some
      ethical concerns. Clerical or computer assisted deterministic record linkage
      methods may suffice for some applications, but probabilistic methods are
      particularly useful for larger studies. The probabilistic method attempts to
      simulate human reasoning by comparing each of several elements from the two
      records. The basic mathematical specifications are derived algebraically from
      fundamental concepts of probability, although the theory can be extended to
      include more advanced mathematics. Probabilistic, deterministic, and clerical
      techniques may be combined in different ways depending upon the goal of the
      record linkage project. If a population parameter is being estimated for a purely
      statistical study, a completely probabilistic approach may be most efficient; for
      other applications, where the purpose is to make inferences about specific
      individuals based upon their data contained in two or more files, the need for a 
      high positive predictive value would favor a deterministic method or a
      probabilistic method with careful clerical review. Whatever techniques are used, 
      researchers must realize that the combination of data sources entails additional 
      ethical obligations beyond the use of each source alone.},

abstract="Bagging predictors is a method for generating multiple versions of a predictor and using these to get an aggregated predictor. The aggregation averages over the versions when predicting a numerical outcome and does a plurality vote when predicting a class. The multiple versions are formed by making bootstrap replicates of the learning set and using these as new learning sets. Tests on real and simulated data sets using classification and regression trees and subset selection in linear regression show that bagging can give substantial gains in accuracy. The vital element is the instability of the prediction method. If perturbing the learning set can cause significant changes in the predictor constructed, then bagging can improve accuracy.",
