# soweego: ensemble learning applied to record linkage

This repository contains the latex _code_, as well as supporting scripts, for my master thesis at
[University of Trento](https://www.unitn.it/en), for the master course in Data Science. 

The pdf version of the thesis can be seen [here](Thesis.pdf). The PDF document has links but these
don't work in Github's PDF viewer (at least at the time I'm writing this). So if you want to clik
on them you'll need to download the PDF and open it manually.

The thesis is based on the work done by the author on the [Wikidata/soweego](https://github.com/Wikidata/soweego)
project. Soweego also has a [project page on wikimedia](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Grants:Project/Hjfocs/soweego).

The development of this work was partly supported by [this wikimedia foundation grant](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Grants:Project/Rapid/Hjfocs/soweego_1.1).

## Files and folders

- `graphics` - contains the images/graphs used in the thesis
- `presentation` - contains a single [org mode](https://orgmode.org/) file which is the presentation I used as supporting material during the defence of my dissertation
- `scripts` - contains various scripts used to generate some of the graphics, as well as a [jupyter notebook](scripts/Ensmble-Basline%20Result%20Comparison.ipynb)
  in which some statistics of the results are generated and compared.

The rest of the files are used by `TeX` to render the final PDF.
